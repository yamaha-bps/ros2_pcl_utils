ROS2 nodes for pointcloud manipulation:

* ```PclFeatureComponent```: Extract edge and planar features
* ```PclSegComponent```: Filter a pointcloud with respect to a segmentation image
* ```PclImageOverlayComponent```: Project a pointcloud onto an image

The nodes assume that the incoming pointclouds have the XYZI structure.

Points with negative intensity are assumed to be non-returns.

## ```PclFeatureComponent```

Extracts edge and planar features from a pointcloud.

NOTE The incoming pointcloud must consist of consecutive laser points from the same laser,
or the algorithms will not work properly.

Features are extracted by

1. filtering out points that are invalid, for example due to
  - Risk being obscured (near a point that is closer to the sensor)
  - Too far or too close
  - Angle from sensor principal axis too large
  - Surface inclination angle too large
  - Close to scan discontinuity

2. Computing **c-values** for remaining points that determine how close a point is to being the average of its surrounding. Small c-values are indicative of a planar surface, while high c-values are indicative of an edge.


```math
  c(p_0) = \frac{\left\| p_0 - \frac{1}{2 W} \sum_{i \in [-W, W], i \neq 0} p_i \right\|}{\| p_0 \|}
```

### Subscribes to

 - ```pointcloud``` - ```sensor_msgs/msg/PointCloud2```

### Publishes to

 - ```feature/plane``` - ```sensor_msgs/msg/PointCloud2```
 - ```feature/edge``` - ```sensor_msgs/msg/PointCloud2```

### Parameters

 - ```window``` - ```int```, default ```5```

   Window width (in points) in feature extraction algorithm.
   At most one feature is detected in each window.

 - ```ang_disc_thresh``` - ```float```, default ```M_PI```

  Angular discontinuity threshold [rad] (between 0 and PI)
  Points in window around a discontinuity are marked as invalid
  Leave as M_PI if scan is known to be continuous

 - ```rel_disc_thresh``` - ```float```, default ```MAX_FLOAT```

  Relative distance discontinuity threshold
  Points in window on the far side of a relative discontinuity are marked as invalid
  since they may be occluded by a small sensor movement

 - ```ang_inc_thresh``` - ```float```, default ```M_PI_2```

  Max angle of ray w.r.t. Y-Z plane [rad] (between 0 and PI / 2)
  A small angle indicates that the surface is facing the lidar
  Points with high angle angle on both sides are marked as ineligible

 - ```max_angle``` - ```float```, default ```M_PI```

  Max angle w.r.t. lidar x axis [rad] (between 0 and PI)
  Points with larger angle w.r.t. lidar center are marked as ineligible

  - ```min_depth```, ```max_depth```, ```float```, default ```0``` and ```MAX_FLOAT```

  Min and max distance from sensor for valid features

  - ```min_intensity```, ```max_intensity```, ```float```, default ```0``` and ```MAX_FLOAT```

  Intensity range for valid points

  - ```plane_thresh``` - ```float```, default ```2e-4```

  Upper cvalue threshold for planar features

  - ```edge_thresh``` - ```float```, default ```1e-2```

  Lower cvalue threshold for edge features


## PclSegComponent

Filters an incoming pointcluod w.r.t. a segmentation mask. Only points that
project inside the image to a pixel that is in one of the specified segmentation classes
are re-published.

Non-returns are re-published.

### Subscribes to

 - ```pointcloud``` - ```sensor_msgs/msg/PointCloud2```

 - ```segmentation``` - ```sensor_msgs/msg/Image```

  Must be an image of type MONO8 where the pixel value is the segmentation class.

 - ```calibration ``` - ```sensor_msgs/msg/CameraInfo```

### Publishes to

 - ```pointcloud_filtered``` - ```sensor_msgs/msg/PointCloud2```

### Parameters

 - ```classes``` - ```int[]```, default ```{0}```

 The segmentation classes to re-publish.


## PclImageOverlayComponent

Projects a pointcloud onto an image as drawn circles and re-publishes the image. Useful for calibration verification.

Point colors are determined by the distance from the camera.

### Subscribes to

 - ```pointcloud``` - ```sensor_msgs/msg/PointCloud2```

 - ```image``` - ```sensor_msgs/msg/Image```

  Must be an image of type RGB8

 - ```calibration ``` - ```sensor_msgs/msg/CameraInfo```

### Publishes to

 - ```image_overlay``` - ```sensor_msgs/msg/Image```

### Parameters

 - ```max_size``` - ```int```, default ```10000```

  Maximal number of points to collect while waiting for the next image

- ```cmap_min, cmap_max``` - ```double```, default 2 and 20

  Saturation values for coloring

- ```draw_radius``` - ```int```, default ```2```

  Circle size
